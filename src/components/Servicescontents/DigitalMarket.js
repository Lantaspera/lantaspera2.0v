                        internet. Businesses leverage digital channels such as search engines, social media, email, and
                        other websites to connect with current and prospective customers. Digital marketing helps you
                        reach a larger audience than you could through traditional methods, and target the prospects
                        who are most likely to buy your product or service. Additionally, it's often more cost-effective
                        than traditional advertising, and enables you to measure success on a daily basis and pivot as
                        you see fit. With digital marketing, you can see the exact number of people who have viewed
                        your website's homepage in real time by using digital analytics software. Unlike most offline
                        marketing efforts, digital marketing allows marketers to see accurate results in real time. It can
                        give you a comprehensive, start-to-finish view of all the metrics that might matter to your
                        company including impressions, shares, views, clicks, and time on page. This is one of the
                        biggest benefits of digital marketing. An effective digital marketing strategy combined with the
                        right tools and technologies allows you to trace all of your sales back to a customer's first digital
                        touchpoint with your business.
