It is the creation of software intended to run on mobile devices and optimized to take advantage of those products' unique features. These applications can be pre-installed on phones or delivered as web applications using server side or client side processing to provide an application-like experience within a web browser. As part of the development process, mobile user interface(UI) or front end design is also essential in the creation of mobile apps. The mobile back end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, work off-line and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components including mobile app server, mobile backend as a service(MBaaS) and service oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure.
